Service class for managing book loan data in a JSON file.
__________________________________________________________

Loan JSON storage service.

This module provides a high-level interface for managing book loan records stored in
a JSON file. It supports adding new loans, retrieving individual records, listing
loans, updating loan details, and deleting loan entries. All I/O operations and schema
validation are delegated to JsonFilesService, ensuring consistent data handling across
the application.
